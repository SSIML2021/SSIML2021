Speculation: We want a capitalism of production, not a speculative capitalism. The effects of extravagant leverage, the obsession with short-term profit, and I say, a monetary disorder that has become unacceptable. We can not win , in Europe, you have said, Jose, to improve the competitiveness of our companies devan I say it my friend the Brazilian Foreign Minister, everyone knows the alliance between Brazil and France, you can not gain competitiveness in our businesses in Europe and have a dollar lose 50% of its value against the euro. As one produces in the eurozone and one sells in the dollar zone, it means that one renounces any selling. I say this to Joseph Stiglitz, and you know how I feel close to the United States of America. But this is not possible. The world has become multi-polar the International Monetary system must be multi-currency. Bretton Woods was in 1945, after the war, in a world where there was one economy, the United States, one currency, the dollar, and one has arranged it like that. Is it that we are now in the twenty-first century in the same situation? The answer is no.
