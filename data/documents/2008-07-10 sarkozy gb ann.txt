But Europe has suffered from something else. Europe has suffered from a lack of debate. I would like to end with this because it dear to my heart heart. Our institutions are independent. But independence does not mean indifference. If we, as the responsible politicians, we do not have the courage to debate, discuss what? What is the right economic strategy? What is the right monetary strategy? What is the right strategy of exchange rate? What is the right strategy in interest rates? Of course, everyone, and I say to our German friends in particular, may have their own beliefs. But nobody has the right to prevent a debate, a debate that is useful. Of course everyone wants an agreement, the trade agreement that is being negotiated. But no one should be afraid to say
Europe does not have to be naive. We need to discuss the benefits of free trade. But we must also tell emerging countries there is no reason why they demand the same rights without assuming the same duties. the debate European must be made without fear. The European debate, we must take on with respect but we have not afraid to defend our beliefs. We do not question our beliefs. We do not compromise the independence of ECB by questioning the fact whether it is reasonable that the interest rate was increased to 4.25 while Americans have interest rates at 2%, we participate in a debate, a quiet debate where no one has the truth (certainly not me), but not necessarily specialists either who must demonstrate the effectiveness of their decisions.
