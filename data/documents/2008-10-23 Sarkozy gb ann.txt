Europe can not be the only one to open its markets without reciprocity. Europe can not have a single currency and a total lack of economic policy. The single currency does not call for the disappearance of economic policy but to their coordination. This is even more true, everyone knows very wellin the face of economic crisis we face. That Europe must face the financial crisis, it must cope with the economic crisis. It must do so even outside crises to avoid precisely that there may be others.

More than ever Europe realizes that she needs a real economic government she just experienced what it could be and that it could be useful. This economic government, it is natural that the Eurogroup should be in the frame. But Eurogroup not like today only at the level of finance ministers, but at the highest political level, the Heads of State and Government who discuss and decide together take their responsibility for the economic crisis as they did on 12 October in Paris. I want to express my amazement. We have the same currency, the same bank, so we need to gather the heads of state and government. I was told: "You innovate and one does not do that not. "Strange! In eight years, the Heads of State and Government of the euro area did not met once, it was not until this crisis that this meeting took place.
